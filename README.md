# Zamonie

The project is only starting, it's not usable nor, in fact, working at this stage.

## Aim

Be a simple CLI tool to manage a JSON database full of films, series, etc informations. One example in `base.jon`

## TODO

- [ ] Fix `mzero` on `FromJSON` instances
- [ ] Alternative to `strArgument` to parse `Int` ?
- [ ] Export/Import from/to CSV
